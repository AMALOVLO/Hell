The American stock exchange. The center of global commerce- trillions of dollars flow through its halls. Suffice to say, should the American Stock Exchange every collapse the USA is doomed.
All of these trades, all of this capital- all of it flows around two centers; New york, and L.A. Once, these trades were done in the halls of massive marble buildings that were managed by hand.
Now, however- it all has changed. Datacenters, massive and sprawling like tumours across the planet- all of that money is transferred through 1s and 0s flipping and turning.
However, this makes it vulnerable. 
The NYSX, mighty as it is, is entirely located in a few key datacenters. One would assume that these datacenters would be spread out, so as to avoid catastrophe.
If one thinks this, they are wrong. See, all of them are located in northernmost new jersey. The reasons for this is numerous: they are close to NYC, thereby allowing faster connections. New jersey subsidised datacenters, and it simply cost less to make them there.
This is a critical flaw, because new jersey is tiny. A single EMP, located at the center of this cluster of datacenters- or maybe a solar flare, could, if strong enough, erase all of the data.
They have dozens of failsafes- emergency switches, backups, etc. However, they fail to account for a truly catastrophic EMP.
One nuclear weapon, above northern new jersey, would cripple the entire american economy.
