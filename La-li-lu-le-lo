THE EPIC PRANK:

Paint is a massive industry, and anywhere between 48-50 million tonnes are made a year. However, there is one outlier: White. 
Although not making up 70% of all paint commercially availlable, white or almost white paint is 70% of the consumption. 
This is because white paint is incredibly important for making other colours. So, of the fifty million tonnes of paint, we can expect
that, should the world decide to only make white paint with its white pigments, there would be roughly thirty million tonnes of white 
paint produced per annum. However, this is disregarding the fact that pigment does not equal paint; and you would need more white
pigment to create white paint than to create lime or aqua or any other colour(s). This is without even mentioning the fact that some
nations wouldnt cooperate with this <EPIC PRANK!>- so lets just say 10 million tonnes because this is MY repository and I CAN DO 
WHAT I WANT!

Anyways, with 500L per tonne, that is 500*10000000, equalling five BILLION litres. One litre can cover 10 square meters, so...

50 billion square meters.

That is about the size of bosnia.
So, lets drop it on bosnia.
This achieves multiple things: first, it shows that bosnia cant get away with being a shitty regime. Second, it helps the climate. Third,
it lowers the risk of serbians sending me anthrax in the mail. 

BYEBYE
