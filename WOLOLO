I really hate OFTD mains in AOE4 in FFA mode. I really, really hate them. Them and their stupid, broken, gilded knight rushes that you cant stop. They are really annoying, and im tired of pretending they are not.
This is without mentioning those torguund spammers who play golden horde! They are even worse- all they do is spam the same unit and give them +500hp and ten melee armor making them virtually unkillable.
Shaolin monks are actually kinda cool, but they are way too spammable. I love the idea of a warrior-religious unit, but, frankly, they are just too strong. 
Warrior monks (rus) are fine, tbh, they are just horsemen with healing. I like them.

Also, in nomad, EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU PLAY AS MALI THERE IS NO GOLD!!!!! One game, I HAD TO MOVE ACROSS THE ENTIRE MAP! TO FIND ONE GOLD DEPOSIT! AND IT WAS TAKEN! 

Also, the hell is up with these new units? like, royal knights are so bad now compared to the newer cavalry that it isnt even funny. They cost more, do less damage, have less armor!

P.S: Theoretically speaking, it would be fairly easy to put together a mostly bullet proof set of armor with a couple sheets of metal. It'd only cost like a hundred dollars, maybe less. Why isnt it more common.
